# **Updates**

After a few hours of work I have setup the enviroment I am working in. I want to keep the dependencies thin. I think I can manage to only use [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). I have a good idea on how my game is supposed to draw to the screen. I have created a 2D array of strings to act as the framebuffer for the game. I have *borrowed* and modified a blit function from [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

As for this website's functionality, I have taken care to have all the tools I need for creating the documentation. I have support for:

## **1.** Syntax highlighted code blocks:
Jekyll comes with it!

```python
print('We have python syntax highlighting!') # Comment
```

## **2.** Flowcharts:
I'm using a JS library called Mermaid and a bit of interface code to use it inside Jekyll. It's very useful.

{% mermaid %}
graph LR
    A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
    A --> C(Round Rect)
    B --> D{Rhombus}
    C --> D
{% endmermaid %}

## **3.** Gantt diagrams:
Another Mermaid graph

{% mermaid %}
gantt
    title A Gantt Diagram
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Section
    A task           :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d
    Another task     :after a1  , 20d
    section Another
    Task in sec      :2014-01-12  , 12d
    another task      : 24d
{% endmermaid %}

## **4.** Tables:
Tables aren't that cool but they look awesome.

 Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
----------|----------|----------|
{% ihighlight python %} print(x**2) {% endihighlight %} | cell 1b  | cell 1c  |
 cell 2a  | cell 2b  | cell 2c  |

[jekyll-talk]: https://talk.jekyllrb.com/

## **5.** Inline Syntax Highlighting:
This was really hard, I needed yet another Jekyll plugin. Works a charm though.

{% ihighlight python %} print("Believe it or not, this is inline!") {% endihighlight %}

# **The Game Engine**

Underlying the whole game is a class named `Engine` that contains code to interact with and draw the ASCII frame. It has support for drawing frames, flushing the screen, blitting images on with transparency and drawing text boxes. As a test, I created a simple demo that shows off each feature along with aditional input taken from the player. This is what it looks like:

```

The large figure to the right is a bad ASCII rendition of [orang](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/surrealmemes/images/8/88/Orang_Transparent.png/revision/latest?cb=20181230153623). To the left is the DVD logo, which moves every frame and bounces off the walls. On the left is a text box which uses extended ASCII borders to draw with. In the middle is a little character I made which has transparency behind him! In order to copy with transparency I needed a special character 'α' to notate which chars are transparent. Here's `man.txt`:

```
αOαα
—|—/
/α\α
```

Anywhere where transparency is required an 'α' is placed instead.

## **How Do You Draw Transparency?**

First you must understand how images are placed on the screen in the first place. Characters are copied from the image to copy (b) to the screen (a) with an offset (x,y). When the computer reads 'α', instead of copying the character it will leave it alone and move on to the next character.

**Here's a flowchart:**

<center>

{% mermaid %}
graph TD
    A(Copy array B to A with transparency) --> B[y = top of B]
    B --> C{y > bottom of B}
    C --yes--> Z(Stop)
    C --No--> D[x = left of B]
    D --> E{x > right of B}
    E --Yes--> F[increment y]
    F --> C
    E --No--> G{"char[x,y] of B = α?"}
    G --Yes--> H[increment x]
    G --No--> I[Copy char from B to A]
    I --> H
    H --> E

    style Z fill:#A33,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px
    style A fill:#3A3,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px
{% endmermaid %}

</center>

**Here's the python implementation:**
```python
# Copy the slices with transparency
for y in range(b_slice[0][0], b_slice[0][1]):
    for x in range(b_slice[1][0], b_slice[1][1]):
        if (b[y][x] != transparent_char):
            a[y + a_slice[0][0]][x + a_slice[1][0]] = b[y][x]
return a
```

An additional piece of code is required if not all of B is on the screen at once. This is what b_slice and a_slice are. The values are computed to prevent an {% ihighlight python %} IndexError {% endihighlight %} when attempting to copy a character out of range. The code that does compute the slices isn't mine so I don't have much to say about it. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
